This is a docker container for automated MEI-Comparison.

USAGE

All MEI files need to be stored in the "data"-directory.

BUILDING THE DOCKER IMAGE
Run docker on your computer
Run "docker build -t main_app ." in your Terminal

RUNNING THE CONTAINER
On Windows:

After the build is complete run "docker run --rm -it -v "\absolute\Path\to\your\Workdir:/app" main_app"

On Mac

After the build is complete run "docker run -it -v "$(pwd):/app" main_app"

You will then be asked to select the MEI-file you want to use for measure selection. You can now use relative Paths like this:

/app/data/

After that you will be asked for the directory with the rest of your files.

You will then have to choose a selection algorithm and the number of samples.

The skript will now create new MEI-files for each sample. You may want to put them in a new subdir for the comparison.

You will then be asked for the directory with the new MEI-files to be used for comparison and a directory to store the comparison results. The comparison will be performed bei Greg Chapman's muscidiff-tool (cf. GitHub) and can be time consuming depending on your computational power.
Don't worry about all the Warnings by the converter21, the comparison will still work.

That's it, congratulations!
